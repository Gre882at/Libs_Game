  ## About Me 👋

Hi! I’m **Adeniyi Vincent Great**, a beginner programmer exploring coding step by step. I recently started learning **Python** (just yesterday!) and I’m also learning **Java**.

I created this project to practice using **input()**, and **print()** in Python, while making something interactive and fun. My goal is to gradually build a collection of beginner-friendly Python projects on GitHub.

I’m open to feedback and suggestions, and I hope this project inspires other beginners to start coding too!
